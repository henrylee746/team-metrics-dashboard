# Velocity Project

Originally began development as a project for one of the line managers at Ericsson Canada, this tool's goal was to return performance metrics of any employee/contractor at Ericsson worldwide who has made at least 1 commit to any repo in Ericsson's Gerrit servers. This tool has since been liked by multiple line managers and retained since my departure from the company, but I continued to develop it into a personal project that could mock the ideal end result I was looking for in this tool without leaking any actual sensitive data. 

## Getting Started

Coming soon!

<!---A separate Google Doc on how to use the tool will come soon, although there will also be a "How to Use" page on the application.

(DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS) In the event you cannot access the URL/the tool is down, here are the steps to access it on your local machine: https://docs.google.com/document/d/103Rhp6hH6jeWM8GF_jjNoVcaItMSqcDdxiWl8IRkMTo/edit?tab=t.0-->
