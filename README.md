# :bar_chart: Team Metrics Dashboard

Welcome to the Team Metrics Dashboard project. This was a personal project originated from my internship at Ericsson Canada, tasked with designing a web application to scrape performance metrics of employees off of pushed code commits using the Gerrit REST API.

## :arrow_right: Extension of the project

Currently, this project does not contain any real information anymore, and everything is scraped off a Supabase PostgreSQL mock dataset. 

## Getting Started

Access the tool here: https://team-metrics-dashboard.vercel.app/
There are two pages at the header: *"Search"* (the main page) for queries and chart displays, but for first-time users, a *"How to Use"* page was also implemented.
