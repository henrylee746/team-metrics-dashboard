# Velocity Project

Originally began development as a project for one of the line managers at Ericsson Canada, this tool's goal was to return performance metrics of any employee/contractor at Ericsson worldwide who has made at least 1 commit. This tool has been retained since my departure from the company, but I continued to develop it into a personal project that could mock the ideal end result I was looking for in this tool without leaking any actual sensitive data.
